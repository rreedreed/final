			<h1>Here's a small story</h1>
			<br>
			<div class="text" tabindex="0">
				<p>In the morning, after the sun has breached the horizon and the dew on the high grasses has started to dry, Malt goes for a walk. The town is still mostly asleep, since the sun wakes much earlier in the summer, and they pass through the empty streets, by the darkened storefronts and sleepy residencies, unnoticed. <br><br>On the edge of town, where the purposeful flower beds turn into thickets of wildflowers, they pause to watch the bees and butterflies busy at work, and decide to pick a single cosmo, one of the deep pink ones, because the yellow center looks so cheerful surrounded by the delicate petals, and they think Solidago would appreciate it. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="text text-2" tabindex="0">
				<p>It’s been a few years since Malt moved to the little town by the sea and restarted their life. Some days they feel newly free, like everything is fresh and liable to be taken away at any moment, and some days feel like they’ve lived this life forever, when their feet take them automatically to the cafe across the street from their apartment in the morning and the barista greets them by name and their coffee is made without them needing to ask, and they sit at the sun drenched window table and watch the other residents of the town pass by on their own morning routines. The simplicity of life here, the abundance of sun and fresh air and the sound and smell of the ocean would have seemed unattainable, practically inconceivable, five years ago.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text" tabindex="0">
				<p>Cosmo in hand, Malt steps into the field. The dew soaks into their pants and shoes but they don’t mind, they enjoy the feeling of walking through the grasses, the gentle rustling and how much like the calm ocean they look when the wind brushes over them. Their walk to the cliff’s edge is relatively short, and soon they’re staring out at the vast expanse of ocean, glittering in the early morning sun, waves crashing rhythmically against the rocks below, and they take a deep breath of the salt air, closing their eyes for a moment to let the breeze wash over them.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text text-2" tabindex="0">
				<p>They make their way down the narrow path to the water with practiced ease, having long grown accustomed to stepping only on those rocks and patches of dirt that are stable. Before stepping into the sand they stop to remove their shoes and socks, leaving them on a rock and rolling up their pant legs. It must be low tide, with how much of the little beach is visible, and they sink their feet into the sand, warm on its surface and cool just underneath, then walk to the wave line and allow the waves to rush around their ankles. The water is cold and sends goosebumps up their legs as they watch the bubbles and little pieces of seaweed swirl around with the movement of the waves. <br><br>After a few moments, they move slowly along the edge of the water to the end of the beach, climbing deftly over the pile of rocks that make up the bottom of the cliff and around the bend to Solidago’s cave. The veins of white and gray marble reflect the blue of the water in a magical sort of glow, and the lapping of the water at the sides of the cave echoes in a symphony of quiet sloshing drips. <br><br>Malt steps just under the cave’s overhang and calls out a greeting to Solidago and within seconds they can hear rustling from the back of the cave, then the splashing of Solidago’s footsteps, and then they can see her bounding towards them. The moment the sun hits her scales, hundreds of tiny reflections shoot around the cave in a dazzling array of dancing lights. She slides to a stop before them, showering them with seawater, and they laugh and wipe the water from their face. They hold out the cosmo for Solidago to see and she leans forward to sniff it, smiles with all her teeth bared, and takes it gently from their hand, holding it between her teeth like a child with a candy cigarette.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text" tabindex="0">
				<p>The two of them make their way out of the cave, Solidago glistening brilliantly gold in the sun, and back to the little beach. She leaves the cosmo with Malt as she romps through the water, tossing clumps of seaweed through the air and diving under the waves. Malt sits against a rock and draws little designs in the sand, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the sounds of Solidago playing. She still small for a dragon, probably as large as the biggest dog Malt has ever seen, but she has grown a lot over the last few years, is certainly healthier now than before, and happier. They’re grateful for the little town, the opportunity to take care of Solidago and watch her grow, the safety and security and acceptance they’ve garnered from their neighbors. <br><br>It can seem almost silly, at times, to think that they used to harbor such fear for the world and the future, now that they are where they are. But, perspective changes everything. And this new vantage point: the little beach, Solidago splashing in the waves, the knowledge that their apartment and store are waiting for them when they get back to town; this they would not trade for anything in all the world.</p>
