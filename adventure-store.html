			<h1>Go into a store</h1>
			<br>
			<div class="text">
				<p>You pass a few stores before you find one you want to go into. It has honey-gold trim and one large window next to the door that gives a glimpse inside. A bell over the door chimes as you step in and the person behind the counter gives you a wave.<br><br>It is pretty small inside but has things tucked into every available space. The shelves are covered in shiny, glittery knick knacks, old looking books, and boxes of varying sizes. You wander around for a while, looking at things, picking them up and turning them over and over in your hands, reading a few pages here and there from the books, holding the shiny things up to the light to see how pretty they are as they catch it, opening the boxes that can be opened to see what they hold. Eventually you find a small box with a stack of playing card-sized sketches inside of creatures; gryphons, giant deer, rabbits with wings, chickens with sharp teeth. <br><br>You take the box off its shelf and bring it to the person at the counter. They make a comment on how much they like the animals and you agree, and search your pockets for some money. You find a five dollar bill, a slightly wilted flower, and a folded drawing of a dragon. The person behind the counter takes the dragon drawing and the flower, and you leave the shop with your box of sketches.</p>
