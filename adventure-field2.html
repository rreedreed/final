			<h1>Walk into town</h1>
			<br>
			<div class="text">
				<p>As you near the buildings, you hear the hustle and bustle of people living their lives. The streets of the town are cobblestone and free of cars; people are riding bikes and walking around. The buildings are wood and stone, some with large open windows, some with brightly painted facades. A few people smile and wave at you as they pass you, and you get the feeling that this town sees a lot of happy, simple, sunny days.</p>
