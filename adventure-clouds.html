			<div class="text">
				<p>You lie on your back and look up, watching the clouds make their slow way across the sky. First you see a baseball player: bat raised behind them, ready to make a swing. Next, a rabbit leaping gracefully over a lumpy rock. Its long ears lead to a dog with its mouth wide open and, above that, a bird with its wings spread wide. Or, maybe it's a dragon. It looks like it has a long tail, and the wispy cloud in front of it could be a breath of fire. <br><br>As you watch the clouds, you can hear the breeze gently rustling the grasses around you and feel sun warming you. Absently, you try to think of anything that you might have to do today, but nothing comes to mind. All there is right now is the sky above you, the ground beneath you, and the breeze against your skin.</p>
